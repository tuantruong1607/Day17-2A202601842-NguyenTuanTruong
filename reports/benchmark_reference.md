`<USER_SUMMARY> The user is studying async/await and coroutines vs Tasks. Their personal project is named ORCHID-27. They have a task to complete a benchmark report before Friday at 16:00, which is an open loop task for LAB-REPORT-1600. The user is debugging async HTTP and has tried increasing the timeout to 60s without success. An effective approach involves reusing the aiohttp ClientSession and setting concurrency to 20. The primary issue identified is connection churn, not the timeout threshold. This incident is related to ASYNC-FIX-20. For the company project BLUEBIRD-42, the backend must use TypeScript with NestJS, and Python is not to be used for this project's backend. Python preferenc`
